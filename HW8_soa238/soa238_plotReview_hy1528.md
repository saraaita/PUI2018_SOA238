**Review of visualization**

As the graph is not shown in the README.md, I get the graph from the ipython notebook

Review by Haoming Yang (hy1528):

Here is my review about the visulization

**CLARITY**: 
The plot is map showing the distribution of firehouses.
It is a simple map. It would be better if it has more explanation on: 

1.why the points have different color? (Are they different in some other attributes? or the color is just for representing different firehouses) It would be better to use unified color if you view all the firehouses the same.

2. What insight could I get from the graphs? A caption may be helpful to convey your idea to audience.

**ESTHETIC**:
The graph will be more succinct if use unified color on the homogeneous variable. The choice of color includes some colors that could not be recognized by color-blind people. It is recommended to use color-blind friendly color map if you would like to include color in your map. 

**HONESTY**:
The data(the location of different firehouses) are well represented on the map.
. 
Summary for the improvement:

1. Consider using unified color for homogeneous variable to help you map be clearer.

2. Consider color-blind friendly color map for enlarging your audience by enables more people to appreciate your graph.

Thank you.
